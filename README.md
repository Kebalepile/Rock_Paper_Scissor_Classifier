# Rock Paper Scissors Gesture Recognition

This project uses deep learning techniques to recognize hand gestures for the game Rock Paper Scissors (RPS) in real-time from a video feed captured by a webcam. It utilizes a pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN) model to classify gestures into three categories: Rock, Paper, and Scissors.

## Features

- Real-time gesture recognition from webcam feed
- Pre-trained CNN model for accurate classification
- Simple and intuitive user interface
- Easy-to-use and deploy

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV (cv2)
- NumPy
- TensorFlow (for model loading and inference)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Kebalepile/Rock_Paper_Scissor_Classifier.git
